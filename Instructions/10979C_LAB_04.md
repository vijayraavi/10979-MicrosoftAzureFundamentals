# Module 4: Web Apps and cloud services
# Lab: Web Apps and cloud services
  
### Scenario
  
You were asked to deploy a blog for the A. Datum public relations team and have decided to use the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service for this purpose.

  -   Site Title:  **AdatumMyBlog## _####_ _(_**where  _######_ is a unique number)

  -   Username: The email address of the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure subscription

  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

  -   Select the  **Confirm use of weak password** check box.

  -   Your E-mail: The email address of the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription

  -   Leave the  **Search Engine Visibility** with its default setting.


4.   Click  **Install WordPress**.
5.   Wait for the installation to complete.
>  **Note:** If your connection to the web app times out, refresh the Internet Explorer window.


#### Task 3: Create a blog post
  
1.   In Internet Explorer, on the WordPress web app webpage, sign in with the following credentials:

  -   Username: The email address of the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription

  -   Password:  **Pa$$w0rd**

  -   Select the  **Remember Me** check box.

  >  **Note:** If prompted by Internet Explorer to store the password for the website, click **Not for this site**.

  -   Main text:  **Welcome to the Adatum blog**

3.  Click  **Publish** to publish the new post.

4.   View the new post.
5.   Close the Internet Explorer tab displaying the WordPress interface, and then return to the Azure portal tab.
6.   Close Internet Explorer.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created and configured an Azure website to support WordPress blogs. 


## Exercise 2: Creating a cloud service
  
### Scenario
  
You need to create an Azure cloud service. You will use the Azure portal to complete this task. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create a cloud service
2.   Deploy a cloud service
3.   Connect to the web app hosted by a cloud service
4.   Prepare for the next module


#### Task 1: Create a cloud service
  
1.   From MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, browse to  **http://portal.azure.com**, and then, when prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure portal, create a new cloud service with the following settings:

  -   DNS name: A unique name of the cloud service consisting of a combination of letters, digits, and hyphens

  -   Subscription: The name of your subscription

  -   Resource group: Ensure that  **Create new** is selected, and then type **LabCSRG** in the text box.

  -   Location: The Azure region closest to your classroom location

  -   Package: Leave with the default setting 

  -   Certificates: Leave with the default setting

  -   Pin to dashboard: Enable the checkbox.


3.   Wait until the cloud service is created, which should take less than a minute. After the deployment is completed, the Azure portal will automatically open the cloud service blade.


#### Task 2: Deploy a cloud service
  >  **Note:** To proceed with the deployment of the cloud service, you first need to create an Azure storage account in the same Azure region as the cloud service.

1.   From the Azure portal, create a new Azure Storage account with the following settings

  -   Name: A unique name consisting of a combination of lowercase letters and digits

  -   Deployment model:  **Classic**

  -   Performance:  **Standard**.

  -   Replication:  **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

  -   Subscription: Your Azure subscription

  -   Resource group: Use the existing  **LabCSRG**

  -   Location: The same Azure region you chose for the cloud service

  -   Pin to dashboard: Ensure that the check box is not selected.


2.   Wait until the storage account is set up.
3.   From the Azure portal, deploy a package and configuration files to the production slot of a newly created cloud service by using the following settings: 

  -   Storage account: The newly created storage account

  -   Deployment label:  **Lab deployment**

  -   Package:  **E:\Labfiles\Mod04\AdatumAds.cspkg**

  -   Configuration:  **E:\Labfiles\Mod04\ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg**

  -   Enable the  **Deploy even if one or more roles contain a single instance** checkbox.

  -   Enable the  **Start deployment** check box.

>  **Note:** Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed with the remainder of this lab. You can monitor the progress of deployment by checking the status column in the **Roles and instances** lens on the cloud service blade in the Azure portal. Wait for the status to change to the Running state.


#### Task 3: Connect to the web app hosted by a cloud service
  
1.   In the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure portal interface, on the blade of the newly deployed cloud service, click the link directly underneath the  **Site URL** label. This will automatically open a new Internet Explorer tab displaying the Adatum Ads webpage.
    >  **Note:** The app is for demonstration purposes and is not completely functional.

2.   Close Internet Explorer.




#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the virtual machines. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created, deployed, and configured an Azure cloud service.



**Question** 
In the lab, you created an Azure cloud service. Which two files did you require to create the cloud service?
